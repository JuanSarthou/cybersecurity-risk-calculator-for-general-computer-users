# Risk Calculator for General Computer Users

A simple web-based risk calculator to help users assess their cybersecurity habits and identify areas for improvement.

- **High Risk (7 to 10 points)**
- **Extreme Risk (11 to 15 points)**

 
The project helps identify areas that may need improvement to enhance overall cybersecurity.
